# Django Blog Project

I did this project when I was just starting out with Django, and this did set me in the right tone. It is a simple blog, that uses Django at the backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript along with Bootstrap at the front end.

I did this with the help of an online course by Jose Portilla at Udemy.
